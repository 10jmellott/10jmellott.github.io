# Joshua Mellott-Lillie

> I am a software engineer currently working at [AccuWeather](https://www.accuweather.com/).
> I have been working on the consumer website, www.accuweather.com for the last several year. This work is primarily
> focused on developing backend hookups to AccuWeather's REST API in the Asp.NET core backend and building out UI to
> display that information to our users.
> In my spare time I enjoy tinkering with micro-electronics, namely [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction)
> as well as working out mathematical problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).
